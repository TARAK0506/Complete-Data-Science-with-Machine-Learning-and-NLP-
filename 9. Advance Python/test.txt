Generators in Python are a special type of iterator that allow you to iterate over a sequence of values. They are defined using a function and the yield statement, which allows them to produce a series of values lazily, meaning they generate values on the fly and only when needed, making them more memory-efficient than traditional iterators.
Iterators are a fundamental concept in Python that allow you to traverse through all the elements of a collection (like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets) without needing to use indexing. An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of the methods __iter__() and __next__().
