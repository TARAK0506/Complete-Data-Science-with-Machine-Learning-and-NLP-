    "# Sets Introduction\n",
    "A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for storing elements where each element must be unique and for performing mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics of Sets\n",
    "- **Unordered**: The elements in a set do not have a specific order.\n",
    "- **Unique Elements**: Each element in a set must be unique. Duplicate elements are automatically removed.\n",
    "- **Mutable**: Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements after the set has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Set Operations\n",
    "- **Union**: Combines all elements from two sets.\n",
    "- **Intersection**: Finds common elements between two sets.\n",
    "- **Difference**: Finds elements that are in one set but not in another.\n",
    "- **Symmetric Difference**: Finds elements that are in either of the sets but not in both."
